# Run Manager
I don't remember what possessed me to write my own tool to manage Windows start-up processes - but I did. It was written during the olden years of Windows XP, so I doubt it will work anywhere else.

I also shudder at the formatting I used at the time.  
What was I thinking??

Tools:  
Delphi 7
